# Analysis for PyBer (Ride Sharing Company)

We took a look at some data for the PyBer Ride Sharing company to study and analyze rideshare data in respect to drivers, city types and fares. From this sample data, we are analyzing the company's data for Urban, Rural and Suburban. Will also showcase total amount of fares for each city type to give us more insight, aswell as the average fare versus the total number of rides and city type. 


# Data Resources
- Riders and City Data From Jan 2019 to May 2019. 
- Data samples reside in two files (city_data.csv and ride_data.csv).

# Breif Summary of result 
Below is an analysis with breakdown by each city type.

We see how the rides and fare data are affected by the average number of drivers for each city type, although the average fare seems to be more than other city types but the total rides and total drivers is less than Suburban and Urban cities. However, the average fare for rides in the rural cities is about $11 and $5 more per ride than the urban and suburban cities, respectively.
